# This expression is a function that takes an attribute set which must have
# exactly the attributes lib, stdenv, and fetchurl.

# It returns the result of evaluating the function mkDerivation, which is 
# an attribute of stdenv, applied to a recursive set.

# The recursive set passed to mkDerivation uses its own pname and version attributes
# in the argument to the function fetchurl. fetchurl itself comes from the outer
# functionâ€™s arguments.

# The meta attribute is itself an attribute set, where the license attribute has 


# the value that was assigned to the nested attribute lib.licenses.gpl3Plus.
